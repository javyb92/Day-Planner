<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
The session on Saturday and replay of the zoom helped me understand, thanks Cody!

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>  I waned to add something else to show that I understand it but being close to another homework I don't want to fall behind. So, instead I added comments into the javascript so I can show that I understand what the session we had and not just be a balant copied code without understanding all just for agrade. If I'm wrong about any of the comments, I'd like to understand it correctly. Also taking this time to mess arond with the readme.</p>
